# BrigsbyBot
A dead-simple way to allow chat users in your twitch channel to earn points (through bits or gifts from mods) and
then spend those points to activate named hot-key combinations on your desktop with the help of the BrigsbyBot 
"Control Box" program which should be included with this.

GETTING STARTED:
- Open Settings.js and enter your channel name, the name of your bot, and the oauth for your bot (oauth can be found at https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
- Open the index.htm (or Release/BrigsbyBot.htm) file in a browser or in OBS
- In the given twitch channel's chat, type !brigsby to check if the bot is active
- Enjoy. Please let me know if you experience any issues with the bot or need any help.
